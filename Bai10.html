    <p>This book was written for network, systems, and security administrators who are responsible for protecting assets in their infrastructure.<span id="dots">...</span>
    <span id="more"> This book is also for those involved in the incident handling process and forensic analysis of servers and workstations.
     Documentation on how to install and conﬁ gure OSSEC has been freely available on the OSSEC website for some time, but a deﬁ nitive guide has never been released. 
     This has left very important and powerful features of the product undocumented . . . until now! Using this book you will be able to install and conﬁ gure OSSEC, on the operating system of your choosing, and provide detailed examples to help you prevent and mitigate attacks on your systems. </span></p>
